# 6 Flow

>This chapter focuses on creating programs that run continuously, therefore making motion and interaction possible. The flow of these programs is further controlled with conditional structures and logical operators.

##### Syntax introduced:

```
draw(), {} (braces), frameRate(), frameCount, setup(), noLoop()
> (greater than), < (less than)
>= (greater than or equal to), <= (less than or equal to)
== (equality), != (inequality)
if, else
|| (logical OR), && (logical AND), ! (logical NOT)
```
